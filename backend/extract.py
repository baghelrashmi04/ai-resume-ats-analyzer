# it is guard rail that controls execution ,it prevents specific code block automatically when file is imported 
# in another file until when the script is executed directly . 
# like here if i will import this file into some other file it won't run the code below if line becuase it prevents it 
#. as we can see also that this is testing code that i am using the function on random file for other import or on site it may crash.
# so if __name__="__main__" means this code will be executed when directly ruuned during testing.
